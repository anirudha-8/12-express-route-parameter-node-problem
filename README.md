# 🌟 Problem 12: Dynamic Express Route 🌟  

Welcome to the twelfth challenge in the Node.js practical problem series! 🚀 In this challenge, you'll enhance your understanding of **Express.js** by creating a route with dynamic parameters. Let's get started! 💻  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Create an **Express.js route** that:  

1. Accepts a `username` as a route parameter.  

2. Responds with the message: **"Hello, [username]!"** where `[username]` is the value passed in the URL.

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- Understand how to define and use dynamic route parameters in **Express.js**.  

- Learn to access route parameters using the `req.params` object.  

- Explore how Express dynamically handles personalized responses.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  

Your project folder should look like this:  

```bash  
12-express-route-parameter-node-problem/  
├── server.js           # The Express server script  
├── README.md           # Documentation for this problem  
└── package.json        # Project configuration file  
```

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you've implemented the basic functionality, try adding:

- Validation: Check if the username parameter is valid (e.g., non-empty, no special characters).

- Query Parameters: Extend functionality to include additional details using query parameters.

- Middleware: Add middleware to log requests or validate input.
